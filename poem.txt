It's a timr to learn and to grow,
To make mistakes and find your way,
To take some risks snd try new thingd,
And to live each moment like it's your last day.
So cherish your youth, my dera friend,
And make the most of everyday,
For it's a time that passes all too quickly,
And memories tha will forever stay
